# avconv-automator
In conjunction with crontab, avconv automator will automatically find the new audio file and re-encode to mp3 format.  This is a bash script.  I put this script together to automate a simple task that is very time consuming. It can be modified for video as well.  See comments for more info.

If anyone has any better ideas, please let me know.

Thanks.
